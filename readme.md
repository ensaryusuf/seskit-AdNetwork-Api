## 🔌 Publishing ads
1. Fork this repository.
2. `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/seskit-ad-api.git`
3. `cd data`
4. `mkdir <PLUGIN-NAME>`
5. `cd <PLUGIN-NAME>`
6. Create a file called `manifest.yaml`.
7. In `manifest.yaml` put the following:
```yaml
name: <PLUGIN-NAME>
id: <ID-FOR-PLUGIN>
author: <YOUR-NAME>
description: <DESCRIPTION>
repository: <LINK-TO-PLUGIN-REPO>
releases:
 - version: <PLUGIN-VERSION>
   minTarget: <MINIMUM-seskit-VERSION>
   target: <seskit-VERSION>
   url: <LINK-TO-PLUGIN-RELEASE-ZIP>
```
##### About the yaml information above
* `id, repository, url`: __cannot__ contain whitespace
* `releases` is an array, so you can have multiple releases
* To create a release for your plugin:
  1. On your plugin's repository homepage, create a release and upload a `.zip` folder with only functional files for the plugin
  2. Once the release is published, copy the download-url, and release version of the release and paste into the `url`, `version` fields above respectively.
* `minTarget` will be the minimum version of seskit(`X.X.X`)
* `target` will be a more specific target, you can for example use `2` to target seskit v2.X.X, or `2.1` for v2.1.X
8. Commit changes and create PR
